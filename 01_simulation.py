# Define a function to roll two dice and return their sum
# Define the function `play_craps_game()` to simulate a single round of craps:
#    - Roll two dice to get the initial sum
#    - Check if it's an instant win/loss (7, 11 = win; 2, 3, 12 = lose)
#    - If not, establish a "point" and roll repeatedly:
#        - If point is rolled again, win
#        - If 7 is rolled, lose
#        - Otherwise, continue rolling
# Define a function `simulate_games(n)` to run `n` simulations and record results
# Save results to a CSV file in outputs/
